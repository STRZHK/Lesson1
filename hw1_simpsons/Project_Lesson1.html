    <p> Homer J. Simpson was born on May 12, 1951 to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was raised on the Simpson family farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol like his father and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car.</p><p>is father forced him to attend Camp See-A-Tree, where he went on a date with Marge Bouvier from Camp Land-A-Man; unfortunately, he lied about his name and sustained an injury while Marge changed her appearance. Homer then accidentally stumbled into Camp Flab-Away and escaped too late to meet with her again, something that left him as heartbroken as Marge.
</p><p>When Homer was around twelve, his mother went into hiding following a run-in with the law and Abe faked her death; before that, she took Homer and Abe to Woodstock, where he ended up briefly adopting the hippie lifestyle, much to Abe's disapproval. Homer, along with Lenny, Carl, and Moe, went to a deep gorge to swim but the water was drained. When investigating why the lake was reduced to a muddy pit, he stumbled upon a decomposing corpse inside a nearby pipe, greatly traumatizing him.
</p><p> When he was 15, Homer participated in a drinking contest by lying that he was 22. However, he became so intoxicated he ended up drinking a whole beer keg used to fill the other contestants' cups. Eventually he was so hungover he missed almost an entire month of school.</p>

    <img src="Lisa_Simpson_official.png" alt="Lisa Simpson">
    <p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.</p>
    <p>In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.</p>
